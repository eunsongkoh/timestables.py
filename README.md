# timestables.py
A multiplication game in python that is solved by voice recognition
Using tkinter, speechRecognition, and pyAudio, the computer randomly generates two numbers, from 1-10.
Once given the two randomly generated numbers, the user is given 3 seconds to say their answer into a mic. If correct, they are awarded one point. If incorrect, they  are given 0 points. This loops for 10 times.
